Hey all
Welcome to the show!

This initial version is pretty lame, but in the future it'll be better...

Here's the story:

I saw Andrew Huang do a video on XLN Audio's software XO, which uses some kind of machine learning algorithm to sort drum samples onto a 2D plane. 
I got the software to play around with, and it's not too bad. 
The Y-axis is approximately decay time/sample length, and the x-axis is relative pitch. 
It works pretty well, but falters when I put my own samples in. 
I found it a bit stifling to search through the categories that they decided to sort on. 
Yes it kind of makes sense, and they were definitely going for generality and organization. 

However, they made a fatal mistake!

The best part of the software is being able to sweep the mouse across the plane of samples and hear the frequencies move, turning the individual drum samples into a very cool sort of aphex-twin drum vibe. 
Any sap can organize his drum samples, 
but being able to do these salacious sweeps of sound-space smoothly separates the sods from the sonically superior, I surmise. 

I sought to create a means of making those kinds of drum sweeps in a versatile way. THAT is what hugsnkisses is.
